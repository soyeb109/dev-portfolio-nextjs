🚀 Just launched my latest project using Next.js! 🚀
After diving deep into the Next.js documentation on nextjs.org/learn, I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project. 💻
🔍 What's Next.js? It's a React framework that makes building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications a breeze. With its powerful features like automatic code splitting, route pre-fetching, and built-in CSS support, Next.js has truly revolutionized my development process.
🛠️ Throughout this project, I've had the opportunity to learn and implement various Next.js concepts, including:
-Nextjs Server Rendering
-Creating Layout and Pages
-Static and Dynamic Rendering
-Nextjs Authentication
