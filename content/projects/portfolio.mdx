## Project Overview

My Awesome Project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase my skills in web development. The project features user authentication, real-time updates, and data visualization. It's built with a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience.

The application allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their data. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, while MongoDB is used as the database. The frontend is built with React, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live updates using WebSockets to ensure data is always up-to-date.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs powered by Chart.js.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop devices.
