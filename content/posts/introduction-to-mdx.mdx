# Getting Started with MDX: Write JSX in Your Markdown

MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to seamlessly integrate JSX components into your Markdown documents. Whether you're building a blog, documentation, or a personal website, MDX provides the flexibility to mix rich content with React components, offering a unique way to create interactive and dynamic pages.

## What is MDX?

MDX (Markdown for the component era) is an authorable format that lets you write JSX within Markdown. With MDX, you can:

- Use Markdown's simplicity to structure your content.
- Insert and use React components directly within your Markdown files.
- Create rich, interactive experiences without leaving your Markdown files.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX brings together the best of both worlds: Markdown's readability and React's interactivity. Here's why you might consider using MDX:

- **Interactive Content**: Embed interactive components like charts, forms, or even entire applications directly into your Markdown.
- **Reusability**: Use React components across different Markdown files, ensuring consistency and reducing repetition.
- **Customization**: Create custom components to enhance your Markdown content, such as custom alerts, tips, or even fully styled sections.

## How to Get Started with MDX

### Setting Up MDX

To start using MDX in your project, you'll need to set it up. If you're using Next.js, MDX can be easily integrated with the `@next/mdx` package.

1. **Install MDX**:

   ```bash
   npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
   ```

2. **Configure Next.js** to use MDX by creating or updating your `next.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
     extension: /\.mdx?$/,
   });
   module.exports = withMDX({
     pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
   });
   ```

3. **Create an MDX file**:
   Now, you can create an `.mdx` file in your `pages` directory and start writing!

### Writing in MDX

In an MDX file, you can write standard Markdown, like headers, lists, and images, and mix it with JSX components.

```mdx
# Hello, MDX!

Welcome to my blog. Below is a custom button component:

<MyButton>Click Me!</MyButton>

And here is some standard Markdown text.
```
