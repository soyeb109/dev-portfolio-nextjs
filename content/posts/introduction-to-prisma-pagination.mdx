# Simplified Guide to Pagination with Prisma

When building applications, you'll often need to display large amounts of data. Instead of overwhelming users with everything at once, we use **pagination** to split data into manageable chunks. In this post, we'll explore how to implement pagination with Prisma, a modern database toolkit.

## What is Prisma?

Prisma is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions in Node.js and TypeScript projects. It supports popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.

## Why Use Pagination?

Pagination is essential for improving user experience by:

- Reducing load times.
- Minimizing data fetched from the database.
- Enhancing readability by showing data in chunks.

## Implementing Pagination in Prisma

Prisma makes pagination straightforward. The two most common methods are **offset-based** and **cursor-based** pagination.

### Offset-Based Pagination

This method is simple and widely used. It relies on the `skip` and `take` arguments to fetch a specific "page" of data.

```javascript
const page = 1; // Current page number
const pageSize = 10; // Number of items per page

const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  skip: (page - 1) * pageSize,
  take: pageSize,
});
```
